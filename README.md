Author: Heather Rollins

A package for my crosswalk-generating code.  

This is a work in progress!! This package is still in the early stages of development.

To install this package on your computer, run the following R code:
```
devtools::install_github("her43/HERcrosswalks")
```

This package contains the following functions:  

acs_tract_to_zcta_fun()
approx_zcta_demo_fun()
city_county_proxies_fun() 
load_tract_zcta_cw()
zip_zcta_cw_fun()  
and various ACS B-table functions, e.g. b01001_()

TASKS IN PROGRESS:  
ZCTA to city
